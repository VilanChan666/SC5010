# SC5010 Data Science Project - Marketing Analysis

![image](https://www.digitalvidya.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Marketing-Analytics.jpg)

Our goals for this project are as follows:

- To create a robust model to predict whether a customer's response(accept or decline) with the given attributes
- To determine the best features (variables) which highly affect the customer's response
- Suggest specific marketing strategies, promotions, or marketing materials to the company to maximize their revenue or optimizing marketing campaigns.
